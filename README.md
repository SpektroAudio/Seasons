Seasons is a sequencer designed to modulate multiple parameters at once.  
In Normal mode, Seasons works as a 4-stage step sequencer. Each of the four steps / seasons is controlled by one of the steps knobs. The four outputs output a different stage of the sequence but they all advance in the same order (akin to a Shift Register). Imagine of those scenes on films when they show the 4 seasons simultaniously, one on each quarter of the screen.  


In Temporal Mirror mode, Seasons works as an 8-stage sequencer. The extra 4 seasons / stages are generated by mirroring the first four stages in terms of order and value (1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - !4 - !3 - !2 - !1). 

The Mode can be set via the push button or via it's trigger input.

The Range knob sets the voltage range of the device (0-10v or +/- 5v) and the Gain knob controls the gain of all 4 outputs.

To get the most out of this module, we suggest sending a clock to the CLK input and to another clock divider module. Then, patch one of the outputs of the clock divider module into the Mode input.
